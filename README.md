# Detect-All
A simple image detection program

Made with [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
Made with **Mobilenet** model that was pre-trained on **Coco** dataset.

If developing locally, you should follow the steps specified in above link.

This notebook takes a downloaded video and does the magic on it and downloads the output file to your system.

But the applications are so much more than that. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoMjIwGSFVQ) to learn to tie it with your webcam for real-time detection. It might be laggy, depending on your system.


It is recommended that you have a system with atleast 8gb RAM or atleast 4gb GPU capacity for this to run fast. 

## Current Statistics

* System
    * **OS** :: Mac OS X
    * **RAM** :: 4GB
    * **GPU** :: 1GB
    * **State** :: No application other than *Python* running

* Video
    * **Video Length** :: 5s
    * **FPS** :: 23
    * **Resolution** :: 480 x 270

* **Time Elapsed** :: 100s - 140s

**NOTE**: This time is the program running time only. If you wish to know the overall time (from start to finish), add **20**hrs to it.


But if your system is slow(er) like/than mine, i suggest you use **[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**. Its an online platform to run your python notebooks on GPUs and TPUs provided by google.

### Directions

1. Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the notebook
3. Click ```Runtime``` and then ```Run All```. Or use the shortcut key ```âŒ˜/Ctrl + F9``` to run all cells.
4. Wait for the download
